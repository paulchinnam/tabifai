Tablature

This app converts raw audio to MIDI using a neural network trained for polyphonic piano transcription. Record yourself playing any instrument or choose an audio file from your device to transcribe!

Don't have an instrument? Click record audio and play out loud to compose midi audio

All of the processing happens locally in the browser using Tensorflow.js
