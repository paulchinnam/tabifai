This app converts raw audio to MIDI using a neural network trained for polyphonic piano transcription. Record yourself playing any instrument or choose an audio file from your device to transcribe!

Don't have a recording? Click record audio and play out loud to compose midi audio

All of the processing happens locally in the browser using Tensorflow.js
